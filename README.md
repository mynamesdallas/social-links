## My process
- I went into this trying to be as semantic as possible. I wanted it to be as minimal and as neat as I could get it and still make it look very professional. 

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I think I'm finally getting a better grasp at using flex and understanding all it's ins and outs.

### Continued development

I need to work more on accessibility and making my sites more impairment friendly.
